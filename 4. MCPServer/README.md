# MCP Server 

As you found out, GitHub Copilot has support for MCP Servers. MCP Servers provide you with a standardized protocol to interact with AI models. In this excercise we will create our own MCP server and connect it to GitHub Copilot.

#### Step 1: Create a new repository
Create a new folder on your machine, in which you create a directory called MCPServer.

#### Step 2: Create a new MCP server
Choose your programming language of choice and implement the example MCP server as described on:
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server#node

For a simple nodejs implementation look at:

#### Step 3: Add the MCP server to GitHub Copilot
