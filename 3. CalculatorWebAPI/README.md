# Calculator Web API with Agent Mode
In the previous examples, we got familiar with using GitHub Agent mode. We will now use agent mode in a more advanced way to help us with implementing additional requirements.

At the end of this exercise your solution will have to meet the following requirements.
- The Calculator app should be transformed into a Web API
- Each operation should be exposed as a separate endpoint
- The API should be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger
- An Azure Devps pipeline should be created to build and test the application
- The application should run locally, use a simple script to test the endpoints, here copilot can help as well. 

Actual deployment is out of scope for this workshop.
